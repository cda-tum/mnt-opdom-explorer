The _Operational Domain Explorer_ is a PyQt6 application that enables insight into the robustness of
_Silicon Dangling Bond_ (SiDB) gates against material imperfections at the atomic scale. To this end, it relies on
physical simulation tools implemented in the [_fiction_ framework](https://github.com/cda-tum/fiction). The Operational
Domain Explorer is developed as part of the _Munich Nanotech Toolkit_ (_MNT_) by
the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at
the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).

## Operational Domain Analysis

The *Operational Domain* was proposed as a methodology to evaluate the extent of physical parameter variations that an
SiDB logic gate can tolerate by plotting the logical correctness of that gate's behavior across a predetermined range of
physical parameters. Given an SiDB layout *L* and a Boolean function *f : ùîπ‚Åø ‚ü∂ ùîπ·µê*, the operational domain of *L* given
*f* is defined in the parameter space as the set of coordinate points for which *L* implements *f*. To determine whether
*L* implements *f* at any given coordinate point *(x, y, z)*, this point can be sampled, i.e., by conducting *2‚Åø*
physical simulations‚Äîone for each possible input pattern of *L*.

## Getting Started

---

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.9 or newer**: This project requires Python 3.8+ to run.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cda-tum/opdom-explore.git
cd opdom-explore
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can set up a virtual environment by
running:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
```

Using `uv` as a package manager? Set up the virtual environment with:

   ```bash
   uv venv 
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment active:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install .
   ```

For `uv`, use:

   ```bash
   uv run
   ```

### Step 4: Running the Application

To start the Operational Domain Explorer, you can run the application as follows:

```bash
python -m main 
```

### Step 5: Running Tests

To verify functionality:

```bash
pytest test
```

[`nox`](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/index.html) can be used to conveniently run many development tasks like
testing the bindings on multiple Python installations.
Here‚Äôs the command split into individual steps for clarity:

1. Install `nox` using the `uv` tool:  
   ```bash
   uv tool install nox
   ```

2. Run the tests using `nox`:  
   ```bash
   nox -s tests
   ```

### Step 6: Contributing

If you're interested in contributing, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Make sure to follow the
coding guidelines and run tests before submitting your PR.
