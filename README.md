The _Operational Domain Explorer_ is a PyQt6 application that enables insight into the robustness of
_Silicon Dangling Bond_ (SiDB) gates against material imperfections at the atomic scale. To this end, it relies on
physical simulation tools implemented in the [_fiction_ framework](https://github.com/cda-tum/fiction). The Operational
Domain Explorer is developed as part of the _Munich Nanotech Toolkit_ (_MNT_) by
the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at
the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).

## üìä **Operational Domain Analysis**

The _Operational Domain_ was proposed as a methodology to evaluate the extent of physical parameter variations that an
SiDB logic gate can tolerate by plotting the logical correctness of that gate's behavior across a predetermined range of
physical parameters. Given an SiDB layout _L_ and a Boolean function _f : ùóü‚Åø ‚üº ùóü·µê_, the operational domain of _L_ given
_f_ is defined in the parameter space as the set of coordinate points for which _L_ implements _f_. To determine whether
_L_ implements _f_ at any given coordinate point _(x, y, z)_, this point can be sampled, i.e., by conducting _2‚Åø_
physical simulations‚Äîone for each possible input pattern of _L_.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### üì• Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cda-tum/opdom-explore.git
cd opdom-explore
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Step 2: Running the Application

First, make sure [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is installed. Second, to start the _Operational Domain Explorer_, run the application as follows:

```bash
cd src/mnt/opdom_explorer/
uv run main.py
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Running Tests

1. Install [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/) and run the tests:

   ```bash
   uv tool install nox
   ```

   ```bash
   uvx nox -s tests --verbose
   ```

### üìú **Workflow Overview**

1. **üìÇ Load SQD File:**
   Begin by loading an SiDB gate as an SQD file. Extensive gate libraries are available in the open-source project [_fiction_](https://github.com/cda-tum/fiction/tree/main/experiments/sidb_gate_libraries). Alternatively, you can use gates designed in tools like [_SiQAD_](https://github.com/siqad/siqad). It is crucial to ensure that the input and output cells are correctly specified in the SQD file.

2. **‚öôÔ∏è Configure the Operational Domain Simulation:**
   The _Operational Domain Explorer_ offers a wide range of parameters and settings to simulate operational domains for various scenarios. This step is divided into three sections: _Physical Simulation_, _Gate Function_, and _Operational Domain_.

   - **Physical Simulation**: Select a simulation engine. Currently, [_ExGS_](https://fiction.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms/sidb_simulation.html#exhaustive-ground-state-simulation), [_QuickSim_](https://fiction.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms/sidb_simulation.html#exhaustive-ground-state-simulation), and [_QuickExact_](https://fiction.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms/sidb_simulation.html#exhaustive-ground-state-simulation) are available, with faster simulators in development.
   - **Gate Function**: Specify the Boolean function the gate is designed to implement. Supported functions include AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR, with more to be added soon.
   - **Operational Domain**: Define how the operational domain is simulated. Choose from Grid Search, Random Sampling, Flood Fill, or Contour Tracing algorithms. Additionally, set the dimensions, range, and resolution of the operational domain. You can also configure whether to tolerate or reject kinks in the operational domain.

3. **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Operational Domain Simulation:**
   Once the settings are configured, start the operational domain simulation. Note that simulation time can vary, taking several minutes for high resolution. After simulation is finished, the settings widget is replaced with a visual representation of the operational domain.

4. **üîç Analyze the Results:**
   Analyze the operational domain to gain insights into charge distribution at any parameter point and understand why the gate is operational or not. Use the slider below the layout plot to explore charge distributions for different input patterns. Keep in mind: if the gate is non-operational for any input pattern, it is considered non-operational overall.
